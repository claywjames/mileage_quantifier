# mileage_quantifier
The second version of my mileage calculator, used for calculating business mileage.  It is a desktop application built on electron.  The application can read .ics calendar files and display the events of a day in-program.  Then, the user will type in a location name(e.g. Panera-Independence).  If the user has never been to this location before, they will be prompted for an address.  If they have been to the location before, the program will remember the address.  After the user is done entering all the locations he drove to that day, the program will swap the locations for addresses and query mapquest.  After getting the results from mapquest, the program will log the date, locations(not addresses), and mileage into an excel file.  I built this program to speed up the process of calculating and logging my Uncle's business mileage.  It is a success, as it reduced the time it took me each month by about 75%.
